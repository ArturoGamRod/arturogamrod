When we get a PDF file and try to print it,the option can appear disabled because the original author did it so. 

<a href="/images/lockedTutorialPDF3.png">
        <img src="/images/lockedTutorialPDF3.png" />
</a>

The solution to this is pretty easy - in most cases - and it  consists of 3 points:

1.-Access to a google drive account.
2.-Upload the file to anywhere.

</a>

3.-Open the file online and print from there.
